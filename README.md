BitWatts is an extension of [PowerAPI](https://github.com/Spirals-Team/powerapi) for building software-defined power meters inside virtualized environments.
To have more details on what is a software-defined power meter, please consult: http://powerapi.org.

# About
BitWatts is an open-source project developed by the [Spirals research group](https://team.inria.fr/spirals) (University of Lille 1 and Inria) in collaboration with the [University of Neuchâtel](http://www2.unine.ch/).

The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007- 2013] under the [ParaDIME Project](www.paradime-project.eu), grant agreement no. 318693.

This project is fully managed with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
